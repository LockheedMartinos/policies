    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 1, 2025</p>
    <p><em>This Privacy Policy is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. Please consult a qualified attorney for legal guidance.</em></p>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Inspectio ("we", "us", or "our") operates the Inspectio web application (the "Service"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you access or use our Service.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      Our Service retrieves publicly available business data from third-party APIs (such as the Google Maps API and Facebook Ad Library). We do not actively collect personal data about you, and any information provided by you (e.g., via support emails) is used solely for responding to your inquiries.
    </p>
    
    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To display business insights, revenue estimates, and market trends.</li>
      <li>To improve and personalize our Service.</li>
      <li>To communicate with you regarding support or inquiries.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We implement commercially reasonable security measures to safeguard the data accessed through our Service. However, no method of data transmission over the internet is entirely secure.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      Our Service relies on third-party APIs, which may have their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review those policies for further information.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The latest version will be posted on this page with the effective date. Your continued use of the Service constitutes acceptance of any changes.
    </p>
